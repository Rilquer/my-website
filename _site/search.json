I am specially interested in integrating different data sources and methodological approaches to investigate intraspecific genetic diversity.\nMy current PhD research focuses on understanding how the ecological characteristics of species influence how they interact with their surrounding environment and shape the demographic history revealed in their DNA sequences. For that, I am integrating several analytical tools along with ecological datasets to evaluate the importance of ecology in population response to habitat change."
